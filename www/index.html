					<small>This lists suggests dependencies to remove in order to remove "tangles" from the codebase. 
					It provides one of many possible sets of dependencies to remove that would make the dependency
					graph acyclic, in a way to preserves the intended semantics of the dependency graph. The heuristic
					used to determine which dependencies should be removed is described in the paper
					<e><a href="https://github.com/zhenv5/breaking_cycles_in_noisy_hierarchies/blob/master/paper/Paper_WebSci_17_Breaking_Cycles_in_Noisy_Hierarchies.pdf">Breaking Cycles in Noisy Hierarchies</a></e>

				<li><a href="report/class-dependencies.risk.txt">Classes ordered by risk</a>.
					<small>The riskiness of each class is determiend using the bi-directional Page Rank score,
					which is the product of the normal Page Rank score, and the Page Rank score calculated
					for the inverse (transposed) graph. The idea is that the page rank score indicates how much 
					a class is influenced by other classes, and the reverse page rank indicates how much it influences
					other classes - and a class that is both very influential, but also subject to a lot of influence,
					is very risky.</small>
